203369,Huawei P9 Plus (P9+) VIE-L29 64GB 5.5 Inch 12 MP Dual SIM LTE Factory Unlocked - International Stock No Warranty (QUARTZ GREY),Huawei,649.99,5,"Didn't make a pre-Order and get out of patience for waiting an iphone 7 plus. I ordered this phone. Use it for 1 day. The phone is nice. Not familiar with the system. I thought it would be very bad, but it looks fine now. I don't play video games. But I hope my phone can be charged fast, and won't get over heated when browsing websites. That's what this phone can do. Charged it once from 9% to 100%, took ~1hr. when browsing websites, I can feel its temperature doesn't change much, maybe it is because it is new and now the weather is cool. Anyway, I like it. Maybe in the future, I will keep using Android phones. Probably from Huawei.",7.0

203372,Huawei P9 Plus (P9+) VIE-L29 64GB 5.5 Inch 12 MP Dual SIM LTE Factory Unlocked - International Stock No Warranty (QUARTZ GREY),Huawei,649.99,5,"I have been using this P9+ VIE-L29 since I received it about 4 weeks ago. The camera is super! If you like to take pictures, you won't be disappointed with the image quality.The phone is easy to set up which only took me few minutes. The smart phone started working the way it should be after plugging in a new sim card from AT&T. However I realized that the 4G label never appears next to the signals bars on the top line of the display. It stays at 3G!!! Despite the good amount of effort from Mega Mobile in helping me to try out various APN settings in addition to what I could find in the internet for AT&T networks, the P9+ that I got just does not run in 4G. I've made sure that Data is enabled on the phone and wifi is turned off but it just stays at 3G. I put another phone, Huawei P8 lite, side by side with the P8+, the much cheaper P8 lite performs in 4G but not the P9+. I live in silicon valley, 4G coverage is very good, so I am very disappointed that my P9+'s 4G is not working. AT&T checked on my sim card, said it is a 4G sim card. Now I am pretty much stuck. If any readers/users out there knowing what I can do, please post your suggestions. Thanks!Update (10-04-2016): Added 3 more stars.Continuing with my investigation on the 4G failure, I managed to borrow a AT&T nano sim card that is proven functioning with 4G. I plugged it into my P9+, the phone immediately operated in 4G! So, it means AT&T issued me a faulty sim card but insisted that it was all good.I took my 4-wk old P9+ to another AT&T store and asked for another sim for my 4G phone. In short, I have the 4G problem finally resolved but during the course of action, I have learned that when AT&T realized that the phone is not from the US, they would choose to disable 4G/LTE or, not to program the 4G/LTE functionality into the sim card despite the phone has the capability and 4G/LTE is being subscribed.

This is my first time using a Huawei smartphone and I promise this is the best phone I have ever used! I have experienced iPhones for many years. The first time I grew tired of iPhone system (and how they purposely use update to worsen the older phones, just so you can buy newer version), I switched to a LG and it failed me miserably, the worst phone I have ever used. I switched back to iPhone and finally decided to try Huawei p9 plus. This phone amazed me!1. It came on time in a really really nice box. It's really easy to set up and google play and other google apps are installed. A transparent case and screen protecter included.2. The double-camera is TEN TIMES BETTER than iPhone 6 plus. All the filters and special effects are cool, make you feel like a pro photographer, it automatically makes your selfies prettier.3. The battery lasts super long. If I don't use it intensively, it will last two days. If I listen to music and stuff, it lasts 1.5 days.4. The fingerprint touch is on the back, which is really interesting to me.5. It gets better signal than iPhone for some reason in my area.6. Its ringtones are so beautiful and sound system is so strong!7. Storage and usage are efficient, it also has cleaning apps already there for you.8. It is just prettier: I got this Huawei Ascend P9 Plus Case, Premium Leather Cover with View Window Protective Smartphone Flip Cover Folio Case (Ultra Thin Slim)(Perfect Fit) by Grand (P9 plus Pink) to go with it, which shows time and weather in a small screen. No one I know has a phone looking cooler than mine.I can totally understand why US doesn't allow Huawei to sell their phones here, because if it is allowed, apple and samsung,LG would be at great risks.p.s. you might encounter one small thing if you are in the US. When you start to text, it might tell you that the number is invalid. All you have to do is change the number to international format, download Twitch! to do it or just type it in as +1 xxx-xxx-xxx, then everything will be fine. It's because this is an international phone.P.S.I bought the second one for my wife!Wow Google Map!",47.0

203384,Huawei P9 Plus (P9+) VIE-L29 64GB 5.5 Inch 12 MP Dual SIM LTE Factory Unlocked - International Stock No Warranty (QUARTZ GREY),Huawei,649.99,1,"I bought this item (Huawei P9 Plus model VIE-L29) from Quality Deals Shopping Center a few weeks ago via amazon website and after a few weeks' usage I start feeling disappointed with this phone, although it does have some good features. But when what you need most is not there, is the phone still worth buying? I am listing all the problems I have seen so far here so that it would be helpful for my fellow shoppers:(1) Group Texting doesn't work the way it should be. I can text to a group of recipients but the message arrives each recipient as individual text message, thus the recipients lose the group information and they don't see other recipients' involvements. This is really bad for I use group texting a lot. I contacted Huawei on this and the reply was that the issue couldn't be fixed since this phone is not intended to be used in US, and Quality Deals Shopping Center is not an authorized seller of the phone.(2) I have to add an extra ""1"" or ""+1"" to the front of each contact number. Otherwise, the messenger will complain ""invalid recipient"". This is a little annoying for I have to go through all my contacts in US to fix their phone numbers.(3) Several free Android applications I use don't work every well with this phone. For example, K-9 Mail was my favorite email client but it doesn't poll messages automatically from background on this phone. I have to open K-9 Mail to get new emails.(4) 4G/3G signal becomes really weak from inside buildings, even though it is a tiny one-story house. I was not in a remote area, but near the center of a big metro area in US where signal strength is usually good and I have never seen it happen to other phones I or my friends own.I would recommend try other models if you really like Huawei phones.",2.0
